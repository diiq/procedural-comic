# Panelling

Divide the page into 1, 2 or 3 sections vertically. Make each division by choosing points on either side of the page, weighted to possibly slant but probably not.

Each horizontal section gets divided into 1-3 sections by the same rules. One slant makes another slant more likely. 

One panel then *might* be subdivided again. 
A circular inset Might be added at an intersection

Each panel gets outlined obeying the gutter
One panel might not have an outline.

Activation network? Page-level and comic-level?
1, 2, 3, slant, not-outlined-panel
activation curves, low high, decays if never-not-triggered, some sense of percent complete?
